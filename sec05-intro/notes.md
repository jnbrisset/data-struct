# Introduction to Data Structure

**Data structure + Algorithm = Programs**

## Data Structure

Collection of values. The values can have a relation in-between or a function in-between each other. The values can be of any type. 

We can think of data structure as a container that holds data. Each container is useful for a specific purpose. We can put things in the container and take things out of the container. We can store numbers, strings, booleans. 

Three pillars of which code is best?
- Readable
- Memory (Space complexity)
- Speed (Time complexity)

There are two steps to understand the data structure:
1. How to build one?
2. How to use it?

## How Computers Store Data

Computers need to keep track of variables, it is stored in RAM. RAM is a big box of switches. Each switch can be either on or off. Each switch is called a bit. A bit can be either 0 or 1.

Storage is said to be persistent. RAM is said to be volatile. Storage will keep the data, but it's slower than RAM.

CPU is the brain of the computer. It can access the RAM faster than the storage.

RAM is like a big table holding 8 bits per byte. Each byte has an address. The CPU can access the RAM by the address.

## Data structure in different languages

### Examples of data structures
- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked lists
- Trees
- Tries
- Graphs
- Hash tables

### Algorithms
- Sorting
- Dynamic programming
- BFS + DFS (Searching)
- Recursion

Each language have their own datatypes. Each languague also have their own data structures. Those data structures can be used but it doesn't prevent us from building our own data structures, which will be the exercise of this course.

## Operations on Data Structures

The operation will allow us to modify the data structure. Depending on the data structure, the operation will be different and will have different time and space complexity. Here's a list of operations that we can do on data structures:
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Searching
- Sorting
- Access
