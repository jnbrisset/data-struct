# Introduction to Data Structure

**Data structure + Algorithm = Programs**

## Data Structure

Collection of values. The values can have a relation in-between or a function in-between each other. The values can be of any type. 

We can think of data structure as a container that holds data. Each container is useful for a specific purpose. We can put things in the container and take things out of the container. We can store numbers, strings, booleans. 

Three pillars of which code is best?
- Readable
- Memory (Space complexity)
- Speed (Time complexity)

There are two steps to understand the data structure:
1. How to build one?
2. How to use it?
